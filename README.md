# Hack-the-Bubble-2020-Halloween (Jungle Thicc)

Used libraries: 
* Tkinter
* pyscreenshot (I think)
* Pillow-PIL

A few more things? 
* Develop this as an online web app - probably peer-to-peer, with a host client able to receive drawings from other people
* Point calculations between rounds - noting whose drawings were used + multiple sessions of drawing
* A final ending screen
